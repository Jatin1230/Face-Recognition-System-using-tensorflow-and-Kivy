# Face-Recognition-System-using-tensorflow-and-Kivy
In this project we have made a face recognition system using tensorflow and design its UI using KIVY
In documents you will create a folder name as App in which you will create a virtual Environment and work on it. There wil be another folder name application data which will comprise of two subfolders verification_images and input iages.
1)verification images = will consists of images of the person whom you want to get verified(app 50).
2)input images= it will consists of image which will be clicked by the system itself when the user clicks the button verify.
There will be two outputs if your image gets verified it will return "Verified" else "Unverified"

You will also have a folder named "data" which will comprise of 3 subfolders name "positive","anchor","negative".Positive and negative will consists of your photos and anchor images will be a set of images which you can take from kaggle itself.

Thank You
